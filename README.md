# CCS_NLP_KFW
 This research project aims to analyze the discourses and themes of German development projects in relation to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). It uses computational text mining methods, such as classification, clustering, and trend analysis, to examine the project descriptions from the KfW project database. The project seeks to answer three research questions: (1) Which SDGs are most frequently addressed and how are they interconnected? (2) What are the common themes and ideas across various sectors and regions? (3) How does the thematic focus shift over time and correlate with investment volumes? The project applies various natural language processing techniques, such as naive Bayes, support vector machine, latent Dirichlet allocation, latent semantic analysis, non-negative matrix factorization, and transformers, to perform the analysis. The project contributes to the field of computational social science and international development research by providing new insights into the discourses and practices of development cooperation.
